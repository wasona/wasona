Learning resources for Toki Pona are abundant. You can certainly learn Toki Pona using some of those instead! I'd like to share the ones I think are good, what I particularly particularly like about them, and what I've tried to improve upon.

## lipu pu by jan Sonja

[lipu pu](https://tokipona.org), also known as *'Toki Pona: The Language of Good'*, is the Official Toki Pona book. The first English edition came out in 2014, with a free update in 2021. It's been translated to German, French, Esperanto, and Persian. A second English edition is expected some day soon. From what I know about the second edition, it is certainly going to be a wonderful teaching tool, and it explains many difficult areas! If you can afford it, go for it!

Alongside the official book, Toki Pona has had a long tradition of free online courses written by the community, and Wasona continues that tradition.

## lipu sona pona by jan Lentan

[lipu sona pona](https://lipu-sona.pona.la/) is a course written in 2020–2022. Compared to online courses before it, *lipu sona pona* has made great strides to show Toki Pona as it's used today! It's been translated to German, Spanish, Esperanto, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, and Chinese.

Compared to *lipu sona pona*, I've tried to focus less on variation among speakers, which was very interesting in 2020 (as the language was really coming into its own), but not too important for a first time learner today. I've tried to include a lot more *sitelen pona*, which hadn't yet come into the spotlight in 2020, and so was relegated to an additional content page.

## lipu sona by soweli Lote

[lipu sona](https://lipu-sona.comforttiger.space/en/) is a course written in 2022–2024. It's been translated to French, Italian, Japanese, and Norwegian. It's quite concise, and has *sitelen pona* throughout.

Compared to *lipu sona*, I've tried to avoid more jargon, like 'modifier' and 'predicate', and using colours for grouping together parts of a translation, which, while informative, can be tiring for the eye.

## Learn Toki Pona! by mun Kekan San

[Learn Toki Pona!](https://mun.la/sona/) is a course started in 2022, and continues to be refined today. It's available both as a text course and as [a video series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoLQoll2U6WEeCO7C2oc1LTWgkoBC8rvT). It puts *sitelen pona* in the spotlight, forcing you to memorise it more thoroughly. It goes quite in depth on many topics, and example sentences are non-trivial and make you think.

Compared to *Learn Toki Pona!*, I'm trying to keep lessons shorter, more focused, so that the learner doesn't get lost or overwhelmed, which makes Wasona feel more similar to traditional courses than to *Learn Toki Pona!*. I've kept some other ideas, though, like the prominent role of *sitelen pona*, and showcasing dialogue.

## o pilin e toki pona by jan Telakoman

[o pilin e toki pona](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_a0s0wowhE&list=PLwYL9_SRAk8EXSZPSTm9lm2kD_Z1RzUgm&index=1) is a video course from 2023. Unlike others on this list, it teaches you purely via *comprehensible input* -- a method of learning through exposure, without grammar explanations in your other language. I've personally not watched it, so I can't say much more about it! I know some people have watched it and liked it.
