## 简单的句子

Now that you know how to read Toki Pona, it's time to learn words and sentences!  
Here are some words for things and actions:

<List>
  <Word sl="soweli" m="land animal, like a cat, dog, cow, mouse, elephant" />
  <Word sl="waso" m="bird, like a pigeon, goose, owl" />
  <Word sl="pipi" m="insect, like a beetle, ant, butterfly, spider" />
  <Word sl="kasi" m="plant, like a clover, birch tree, cactus, moss" />
  <Word sl="moku" m="to consume" />
  <Word sl="lukin" m="to see" />
  <Word sl="sona" m="to know" />
</List>

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  When translating word definitions, such as "land animal", "insect", "plant",
  it's better to use everyday words rather than scientific ones.
*/}

A very common kind of sentence is called a "subject-verb-object" sentence. This means that one thing (the subject) does something to another thing (the object). Let's make a few sentences:

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  Your language may instead be SOV or VSO. If it is, please draw attention
  to this difference between your language and Toki Pona.
*/}

<List>
  <Sentence sl="soweli li moku e kasi." m="The animal eats plants." />
  <Sentence sl="waso li moku e pipi." m="The bird eats bugs." />
  <Sentence sl="pipi li lukin e soweli." m="The insect sees an animal." />
  <Sentence sl="waso li sona e kasi." m="The bird knows the tree." />
</List>

Here's what we can learn:

- The word order is the same as in English: subject, verb, object.
- **󱤧 li** is a particle that starts the verb.
- **󱤉 e** is a particle that starts the object.
- The English translation includes words and word-pieces like "the", "an", "-s", but those are guesses! The Toki Pona sentence doesn't specify if we're talking about "_a_ bird" or "_the_ bird". In longer conversations, it becomes pretty clear!

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  Your language may not have articles. Your language may have gender markers.
  You can adjust the bullet point above to better suit your language.
*/}

(**󱤧 li** and **󱤉 e** may seem unnecessary at first. We will learn about why they are required, but to do that, we first need to learn more about parts of speech!)
