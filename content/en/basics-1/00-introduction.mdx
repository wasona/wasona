## What is Toki Pona?

Toki Pona is a constructed language created in 2001 by French-Canadian polyglot Sonja Lang. At first a small community of fans emerged, and around 2020 the language rapidly grew in popularity. It is now the second [most widely spoken conlang](https://tokipona.org/conlang_communities) after Esperanto!

Toki Pona is designed with simplicity and fun in mind. Its sounds are easy to pick up. Its 130-ish words are broad in meaning, and every single one has something interesting about it. Its grammar is simple by default, and powerful when needed.

You'll find Toki Pona in [online](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE) [spaces](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x), [songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeCE5N29ioyUbj_lvYm9IdGJnE2HPacVv), [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOmpMyMxd8Qs2mAXcLk817tQy_AQj09u), [zines](https://liputenpo.org/), and [books](https://tokipona.org/). The language is very versatile -- with skill, you can learn to talk about anything, from [weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fCq1aEAxA) to [world news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljZfGt7PDxk), from [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr3ufODuIts) to [microtonality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fedFQIHREMo), from [counting cows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxClPfZDn-E) to [investment strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIOT3bRzAGI).

## What is Wasona?

There are [many ways](/en/other-courses/) to learn the language. In this course, we've put together ~30 short lessons. You slowly learn new words and grammar. After each lesson, you get to practice vocabulary with a little interactive game. After every ~10 lessons, we get to "zoom out" and see how people use Toki Pona for different needs: a short story, a dialogue, a song. Sometimes you'll find a commonly asked question or interesting topic at the bottom of the lesson.

The course will **not make you fluent**, but it will set you up for success! After reading and practicing, you will be familiar with how the language works. You will be able to hold a conversation, read, and listen. Reading the course takes several days or weeks, but developing the intuition and speed of a proficient speaker takes months or years.

Tips to get the most out of the course:
* Pronounce every example aloud!
* When the practice game says you got something wrong, try to explain to yourself what's different and why. There's always an explanation above!
* Sometimes you can't make sense of things. That's okay! Please talk to a proficient speaker, and they'll explain it nicely. There are always people willing to [help you learn](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE)!
