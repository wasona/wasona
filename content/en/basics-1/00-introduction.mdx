## What is Toki Pona?

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  Different languages have different traditions for how to spell "Toki Pona".
  Please ask your local Toki Pona speaker.
  If your language does not use the Latin script, please adapt the name
  into your script -- токи пона, Τόκι Πόνα, ტოკი პონა and so on.
*/}

Toki Pona is a constructed language created in 2001 by French-Canadian polyglot Sonja Lang. At first a small community of fans emerged, and around 2020 the language rapidly grew in popularity. It is now the second [most widely spoken conlang](https://tokipona.org/conlang_communities) after Esperanto!

Toki Pona is designed with simplicity and fun in mind. Its sounds are easy to pick up. Its 130-ish words are broad in meaning, and every single one has something interesting about it. Its grammar is simple by default, and powerful when needed.

{/*
  "simple by default, and powerful when needed" is a reference
  to a slogan by KDE, an open source organisation.
  You can find the slogan here: https://develop.kde.org/hig/simple_by_default/
  You can translate it literally, or see if the KDE community
  has already provided a translation for the slogan.

You'll find Toki Pona in [online](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE) [spaces](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x), [songs](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeCE5N29ioyUbj_lvYm9IdGJnE2HPacVv), [podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOmpMyMxd8Qs2mAXcLk817tQy_AQj09u), [zines](https://liputenpo.org/), and [books](https://tokipona.org/). The language is very versatile -- with skill, you can learn to talk about anything, from [weather](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J4fCq1aEAxA) to [world news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljZfGt7PDxk), from [love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr3ufODuIts) to [microtonality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fedFQIHREMo), from [counting cows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxClPfZDn-E) to [investment strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIOT3bRzAGI).

## What is Wasona?

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  Your language might have a distinction between
  singular/informal "you", and plural/formal "you".
  Translations of Wasona usually use a formal "you",
  but not too formal otherwise. The tone should be similar
  to a friendly chat with a professor in a university.

There are [many ways](/en/other-courses/) to learn the language. In this course, we've put together ~30 short lessons. You slowly learn new words and grammar. After each lesson, you get to practice vocabulary with a little interactive game. After every ~10 lessons, we get to "zoom out" and see how people use Toki Pona for different needs: a short story, a dialogue, a song. Sometimes you'll find a commonly asked question or interesting topic at the bottom of the lesson.

The course will **not make you fluent**, but it will set you up for success! After reading and practicing, you will be familiar with how the language works. You will be able to hold a conversation, read, and listen. Reading the course takes several days or weeks, but developing the intuition and speed of a proficient speaker takes months or years.

Tips to get the most out of the course:
* Pronounce every example aloud!
* When the practice game says you got something wrong, try to explain to yourself what's different and why. There's always an explanation above!
* Sometimes you can't make sense of things. That's okay! Please talk to a proficient speaker, and they'll explain it nicely. There are always people willing to [help you learn](https://discord.gg/ChC6qtVsSE)!

  If there is anything you want to tell your readers as
  a "foreword from a translator", please put it in this file
  right below this translator note. For example, this is
  what I wrote for the Russian translation:

## A foreword from the translator

The course was originally written in English by me, and I also did the Russian translation. The explanation of the phonetics have been adapted to the expectations of Russian speakers. Some grammar concepts, such as *predicate* or *accusative case* are more familiar to a Russian speaker than to an English speaker, so I felt like I was allowed to use it in the translation, rather than rephrasing them to make sense to a layman. Nevertheless the course does not rely on them too much.
