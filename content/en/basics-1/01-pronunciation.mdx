{/*
  This is the most challenging lesson to translate,
  because you have to use your own judgement for
  what's similar between your language and Toki Pona, and what's different.
  Think about ways in which Toki Pona spelling may mislead your readers.

If you speak English, most of these will be familiar to you! But there are two differences you should pay close attention to:

* Toki Pona **j** is pronounced like English **y** as in *young*, not English **j** as in *jam*. That's how German, Finnish, Albanian, and many other languages use the letter j.
* English has a very complicated system for reading vowels! The Toki Pona system is much more straightforward. You may recognise it if you've ever learned Spanish, Japanese, modern Hebrew, or many other languages. Each vowel is pronounced the same way everywhere, and there are no silent letters.

A single syllable in English can hold many consonants: *strengths*, *sprite*, *fifths*. But in Toki Pona, only one consonant can come before a vowel, and only **n** can come after a vowel: *ken*, *li*, *wan*, *a*.

The stress falls on the first syllable: <u>po</u>na, <u>a</u>la, and even in longer words: <u>ka</u>lama, <u>a</u>kesi.
