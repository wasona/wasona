In the previous lesson, we looked at **󱥍 pi**. As you saw, there are many phrases with two very reasonable meanings, depending on if they have **󱥍 pi** or not. But there are also a lot of phrases which make *very little sense* if  **󱥍 pi** is missing! You'll see this a lot with names:

<List>
  {/*<Word sl="pi" m="" />*/}
  <Sentence sl="soweli pi jan Ema" m="Emma's dog" />
  <Sentence sl="soweli jan Ema" m="A human-like dog named Emma (???)" />
  <Sentence sl="toki pi jan Mili" m="Millie's speech" />
  <Sentence sl="toki jan Mili" m="A human language named Millie (???)" />
</List>

If you don't use **󱥍 pi**, the name instead applies to the *first* word! And that can turn out to be silly. For this reason, you will often find **󱥍 pi** near names!

You will also often find it after words that refer to locations, such as these new ones:

<List>
  <Word sl="selo" m="skin, peel, shell, bark" />
  <Word sl="insa" m="the internal part, centre, middle" />
  <Word sl="monsi" m="back, rear" />
  <Word sl="sinpin" m="face, front, wall" />
  <Word sl="anpa" m="bottom; to defeat" />
</List>

Let's use them in some sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="selo kasi li kiwen." m="The bark of a tree is hard and wooden." />
  <Sentence sl="selo pi kasi ni li pakala." m="The bark of this tree is damaged." />
  <Sentence sl="soweli li lon insa tomo." m="The cat is inside the house." />
  <Sentence sl="o tawa insa pi tomo mi!" m="Go inside my house!" />
  <Sentence sl="sinpin pi jan Ali li pona." m="Ali's face is nice." />
  <Sentence sl="mani li lon anpa pi telo suli." m="The treasure is on the ocean floor." />
</List>

Protip: since **󱥍 pi** only exists for rebracketing, it will never occur before just one word! There are always two words or more after it.
