Toki Pona has been using Latin characters since 2001, and sitelen pona since 2014.
But there is another writing system -- **sitelen sitelen**, also known as **sitelen suwi**. It was created in 2009 by Jonathan Gabel. This is what it looks like:

Most Toki Pona speakers today cannot read *sitelen sitelen*, and very few use it. While *sitelen pona* is genuinely used in casual conversation, *sitelen sitelen* usually only shows up for decorative purposes.

If you want to learn to read and write *sitelen sitelen*, you can use [Jonathan Gabel's lessons](https://jonathangabel.com/toki-pona/).
