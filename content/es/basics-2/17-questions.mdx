## Questions

Questions usually come in two flavours:

* *yes / no questions*. These are questions that can be answered with yes or no, positively or negatively.

* *open-ended questions*. These are like filling the blanks: who did it? did what? to whom? where? why?

## Yes / no questions

### Question

Remember how in the previous lesson, we've learned to negate a sentence by finding the first word in the verb? We do something similar to make yes / no questions. We *double* the first word in the verb, and put an **󱤂 ala** in between:

<List>
  <Word sl="moku ala moku" m="does ... eat?" />
  <Sentence sl="pipi li moku ala moku e len?" m="Does the moth eat the cloth?" />
  <Word sl="pona ala pona" m="is ... good?" />
  <Sentence sl="kalama musi li pona ala pona tawa sina?" m="Is the music good to you? (Do you like the music?)" />
  <Word sl="wile ala wile" m="does ... want to ...?" />
  <Sentence sl="sina wile ala wile lape lon supa?" m="Do you want to sleep in the bed?" />
  <Word sl="lon ala lon" m="is ... at ...?" />
  <Sentence sl="ona li lon ala lon ma Mewika?" m="Are they in the US?" />
</List>

It's a little unusual to an English speaker! But you can see something similar in [Mandarin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-not-A_question#A-not-AB_form_4).

### Answer

English has a special word for 'yes'. Toki Pona instead does what Finnish, Mandarin, Latin, and many other languages do: you reply with the verb for 'yes', and a verb + **󱤂 ala** for 'no'.

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sitelen li musi ala musi?" m="Is the video fun?" />
  <Word sl="musi." m="fun. (= It is.)" />
  <Word sl="musi ala." m="not fun. (= It's not.)" />
</List>

The **V ala V** pattern is very common! But there's another one:

<List>
  <Word sl="seme" m="what? which?" />
  <Word sl="anu" m="or" />
  <Word sl="anu seme" m="... right? isn't it? or what?" />
</List>

You can add **󱤇󱥙 anu seme** at the end of any statement to make it a question:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sitelen li musi anu seme?" m="The video is fun, right?" />
</List>

You can answer it with **󱤻 musi** or **󱤻󱤂 musi ala**, just like a normal yes / no question! But the vibe is slightly different. If you use **󱤇󱥙 anu seme**, it's more likely that you expect the other person to agree with you.

## Open-ended questions

So we just learned that **󱥙 seme** means 'what?', and it's the most important part of *open-ended questions*! **󱥙 seme** is like a blank space in the sentence that you want the other person to fill in with their information:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="waso li lon seme?" m="Where is the bird? (lit. 'The bird is at what?')" />
  <Sentence sl="waso li lon tomo." m="The bird is at home." />
  <Sentence sl="soweli li utala e jan seme?" m="Who did the animal attack? (lit. 'The animal attacked which person?')" />
  <Sentence sl="soweli li utala e jan Ema." m="The animal attacked Emma." />
</List>

Notice how only **󱥙 seme** gets swapped out for the answer -- everything else in the sentence stays in the same order! This is unlike English, where questions reorder the sentence, to put the wh-word first, but Toki Pona doesn't do that.
