We live in a society! Let's learn some words that are useful for navigating a society:

<List>
  <Word sl="kulupu" m="community, team, group" />
  <Word sl="nasin" m="way, method, tradition, path" />
  <Word sl="esun" m="to swap, to trade; market, shop" />
  <Word sl="mani" m="money, valuable thing" />
  <Word sl="moli" m="dead; to kill" />
  <Word sl="mute" m="many, very" />
</List>

Let's use the new words in sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="nasin mute li lon." m="There are many traditions." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li pali lon kulupu." m="People work in teams." />
  <Sentence sl="len pona li wile e mani mute." m="Good clothes require a lot of money." />
  <Sentence sl="jan mute li moli tan utala suli." m="Many people died because of the war."/>
  <Sentence sl="mi wile esun e soweli mi." m="I would like to sell my cow." />
  <Sentence sl="mi wile ala esun e soweli sina." m="I don't want to buy your cow." />
</List>

Here is something fun you might notice: **󱤋 esun** generally means 'to swap', but there's enough information in the sentence to know that it specifically means 'to sell' in one sentence, and 'to buy' in another!

## more about mute

**󱤼 mute** is a very useful word to have. We don't see adjectives attach to pronouns **󱤴 mi**, **󱥞 sina**, **󱥆 ona** all that often, but **󱤼 mute** is so useful that it does that quite frequently:

<List>
  <Word sl="mi mute" m="we, many of us" />
  <Sentence sl="kulupu pali li jo e mi mute." m="The labour union includes a lot of us." />
  <Word sl="sina mute" m="you lot, you guys, y'all" />
  <Sentence sl="ona li ken sitelen e sina mute." m="They can take a picture of you guys." />
</List>

Remember the special rule that says: "when **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina** is the subject of the sentence, we remove the **󱤧 li**"? That rule is quite specific! Take a look at these sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi mute li kalama musi." m="We perform music together." />
  <Sentence sl="sina mute li sona e ni." m="Many of you know this." />
</List>

Notice how the **󱤧 li** isn't dropped! This is because the subject isn't either **󱤴 mi** or **󱥞 sina**, but instead **󱤴󱤼 mi mute** and **󱥞󱤼 sina mute**.

It might seem like an odd quirk, but remember -- the purpose of **󱤧 li** is to show where the verb starts! If it was dropped here, we would instead assume **󱤼 mute** is the verb.
