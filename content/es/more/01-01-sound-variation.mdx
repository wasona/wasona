**tl;dr**: There is some variation, but it's fairly small. If you're just casually learning, just mimic the audio you find throughout the [beginners course](es/01/)!

If you like the study of sounds in languages, and can read the [IPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet), this page is for you!

There are some small differences in pronunciation between different Toki Pona speakers. Voicing, aspiration, and several other differences listed below do not make a meaningful difference in Toki Pona, but some pronunciations are more common than others.

There are two main sources for sound variation in Toki Pona: the **influence of your native language**, and **personal preference**.

## Native language influence

[Most Toki Pona speakers can speak English](https://tokiponacensus.github.io/results2022/#what-languages-do-tokiponists-know), and many also speak Spanish, French, Japanese, German, Chinese, Russian, etc. These languages' sound systems are different from Toki Pona, which may influence a learner to speak slightly differently than most. As learners become more skilled, they *usually adapt* to a more common, neutral pronunciation.

Aspiration is a puff of air that can come after a consonant. In Toki Pona, /p t k/ are typically unaspirated. English-speaking learners often aspirate them, because they are aspirated [pʰ tʰ kʰ] in English.

In French, ⟨s⟩ is usually voiced [z] between vowels, so French speakers sometimes pronounce words like *'musi'* as *[muzi]*.

In languages like German, Russian, Hungarian, etc, there is no /w/ sound, but there is a /v/ sound, which is very similar. Speakers of those languages can sometimes be heard pronouncing *'tawa'* like *[tava]*.

Japanese doesn't have /l/, but it has /ɾ/, which is similar. You'll often hear *[ɾiɾi]* for '*lili*' a lot in vocal synth songs, because they use technology originally created for Japanese.

In Russian, there are two L-sounds: ⟨л⟩ /ɫ/ and ⟨ль⟩ /lʲ/. They are called 'hard' and 'soft', or 'velarised' and 'palatalised'. Toki Pona /l/ is a more neutral sound, in between the two extremes. Because of this, a Russian learner might pronounce words like *'len'* either too 'dark' or too 'soft'.

In English, vowels /ɛ/ (like in *'dress'*) and /ɔ/ (like in *'cloth'*) cannot appear at the end of a word, but vowels /ɛj/ (like in *'stay'*) and /əw/ (like in *'know'*) can. This causes many English-speaking learners of Toki Pona to pronounce vowels with a bit of an offglide: *[ikej]*, *[wasow]*.

## Personal preference

Some small variation is mostly due to personal preference. Other speakers will likely not even notice unless they're trying!

Some pronounce /t/ like [t], others like [t̪]. Both are good. If you don't know what the difference is, that's a good sign it doesn't matter!

Most speakers *assimilate* /n/ + consonant sequences, which means /n/ starts to sound more like the consonant that comes next. English does it with ⟨nk⟩ [ŋk], but in Toki Pona you'll also hear /np/ [mp] all the time.

But this usually happens *inside* a word, like *anpa*, *Sonko*, *linja*. A minority of speakers (including me, kala Asi) also assimilate between words: they pronounce *ken pona*, *ken kama* like *kem pona*, *keŋ kama*.

Words that start with a vowel are also interesting. Because words can start with a vowel, you can have several vowels in a row in Toki Pona: *mi son**a e o**na.* Most speakers will just gradually transition from one vowel to the next. Some will start the word with a *glottal stop* [ʔ] to break up the vowels. Sometimes, [especially](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FimMEOCRWUA) from [singers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=96PM_jUdS2M), you might hear words start with a [h].
