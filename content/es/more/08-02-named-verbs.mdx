You may have noticed sentences like:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki Inli." m="The person speaks English." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi Manka." m="The person plays Minecraft." />
</List>

But in English, these sentences are Subject-Verb-Object. *'English'* and *'Minecraft'* would be the object of the sentence. But there's no object in Toki Pona -- you can tell that, because there's no **󱤉 e**. How does it work, then?

Well, the translation is a bit misleading. Here's what it means more literally:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki Inli." m="The person speaks English-ly." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi Manka." m="The person plays Minecraft-ly." />
</List>

We've already talked about how *adjectives* and *adverbs* are the same thing in Toki Pona, and names are adjectives. So logically, they can be adverbs, too! It's grammatically similar to sentences like:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki suwi." m="The person speaks adorably." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi pona." m="The person plays well." />
</List>

## Are there alternatives?

Yes! In fact, this style with names as adverbs is relatively recent in popularity. The older style looks like this:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki lon toki Inli." m="The person speaks in English." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki kepeken toki Inli." m="The person speaks by means of English." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi lon musi Manka." m="The person has fun in Minecraft." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi kepeken musi Manka." m="The person has fun by means of Minecraft." />
</List>

## Can I say 'toki e toki ...' or 'musi e musi ...'?

This was relatively common in the past! But nowadays, the meaning might be understood a bit different from what you want:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li toki e toki Inli." m="The person speaks about English.<br />(makes sense, but in a different situation)" />
  <Sentence sl="jan li musi e musi Manka." m="The person entertains Minecraft. (???)" />
</List>
