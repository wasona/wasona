In English, a lot of conversations begin with _'What are you doing?'_. _'To do'_ is a stand-in for any action:

- What are you _doing_?
- I'm _working_ on the book.
- I'm _buying_ clothes.
- I'm _having fun_.
- I'm _resting_.

But how do you say that in Toki Pona?

Let's start by recalling some _pronouns_. A _pronoun_ is a generic stand-in, usually for a noun:

<List>
  <Word sl="ni" m="this, that" />
  <Word sl="ijo" m="something, thing, stuff" />
  <Word sl="seme" m="what? which?" />
</List>

The key is to remember that in Toki Pona, nouns can be verbs. When introduced by **󱤧 li** or **󱥄 o**, they become generic stand-ins for actions, just like 'to do' does:

<List>
  <Word sl="ni" m="to do this, to do that" />
  <Word sl="ijo" m="to do something" />
  <Word sl="seme" m="to do what?" />
</List>

You can make a question with **󱥙 seme**-verb, and answer it with a verb, just like in the English example:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sina seme?" m="What are you doing?" />
  <Sentence sl="mi esun e len." m="I'm buying clothes." />
</List>

You can even specify the object, although this is not quite as frequent in conversations:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sina seme e len?" m="What are you doing to the clothes?" />
  <Sentence sl="mi esun e ona." m="I'm buying them." />
</List>

**󱥁 ni**-verb can be very useful when doing things together with someone:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="o pana e moku tawa soweli mi!" m="Please feed our cat!" />
  <Sentence sl="mi ni." m="I'm doing this. (= Got it! On it!)" />
</List>

You won't see **󱤌 ijo**-verb quite as often, but it can be nice when you're deliberately being vague:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="ona li seme?" m="What is she doing?" />
  <Sentence sl="ona li ijo e lipu mi!" m="She is doing something to my book!" />
</List>
