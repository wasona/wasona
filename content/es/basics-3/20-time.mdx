Let's talk about time! You may have noticed I translate the sentences inconsistently: sometimes they talk about the present, sometimes the past, sometimes the future. This is because by default, a Toki Pona sentence carries no time information, so it could be anything! But of course, we can choose to be more specific, by using words related to time.

Let's learn some of them:

<List>
  <Word sl="tenpo" m="time, moment, situation" />
  <Word sl="sike" m="round, repeating, yearly; circle, ball" />
  <Word sl="mun" m="moon, celestial body" />
  <Word sl="suno" m="sun, daylight; bright" />
  <Word sl="sin" m="new, fresh; again" />
  <Word sl="poka" m="side, vicinity; nearby" />
</List>

You already know how to talk about location in *space*. Location in *time* is very similar:

<List>
  <Word sl="lon tenpo kama" m="in the coming time, in the future" />
  <Word sl="lon tenpo pini" m="in the finished time, in the past" />
  <Word sl="lon tenpo ni" m="during this time" />
  <Sentence sl="soweli lili mi o kama suli lon tenpo kama!" m="May my little cat grow big in the future!" />
  <Sentence sl="ma Loma li ma suli lon tenpo weka." m="Rome was a large empire long ago." />
</List>

Time often serves as a sort of "scene", a "context" for the rest of the speech. Often, we like to put such context at the beginning of the sentence, like I just did in this one! Toki Pona has a word that helps with that:

<List>
  <Word sl="la" m="as for ..., speaking of ..., when ..., if ... " />
  <Word sl="ken la" m="perhaps, ..." />
  <Word sl="open la" m="to begin with, ..." />
  <Word sl="lipu la" m="as for the book, ..." />
  <Word sl="tenpo la" m="sometimes, ..." />
  <Word sl="tenpo pini la" m="in the past, ..." />
  <Word sl="tenpo suno kama la" m="the next day, ...; tomorrow, ..." />
  <Sentence sl="sin la mi wile toki e ni:" m="Once again, I just want to say that..." />
  <Sentence sl="mi pali e ni lon tenpo kama poka." m="I will work on this soon." />
</List>

**󱤡 la** can also be used between two sentences, connecting them into one. The first sentence then becomes a condition *'if or when ...'*, and the second is the result: *'then ...'*.

<List>
  <Word sl="suno li pini." m="The sun sets." />
  <Word sl="mi lape." m="I sleep." />
  <Sentence sl="suno li pini la, mi lape." m="When the sun sets, I sleep." />
</List>
