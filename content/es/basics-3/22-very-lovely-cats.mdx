We've recently learned **󱤼 mute**, which is a very useful word!

Let's think a bit more about it. We already know how to form these phrases:

<List>
  {/*<Word sl="pi" m="" />*/}
  <Word sl="soweli suwi" m="a lovely cat" />
  <Word sl="soweli mute" m="many cats" />
  <Word sl="suwi mute" m="very lovely" />
</List>

But what if we put them all together? Will we get *many lovely cats* or *a very lovely cat*?

<List>
  <Word sl="soweli suwi mute" m="many lovely cats" />
</List>

This phrase means *many lovely cats*, because **󱥦 suwi** describes **󱥢 soweli**, and **󱤼 mute** also describes **󱥢 soweli**.  
But I think *my* cat is very lovely! How do I talk about it? What if I want **󱤼 mute** to describe **󱥦 suwi**, instead of describing **󱥢 soweli**?  
This is where a new particle helps us:

<List>
  <Word sl="pi" m="a particle that groups adjectives" />
  <Word sl="soweli pi suwi mute" m="a very lovely cat" />
</List>

Hooray! Now we can talk about a **󱥢 soweli** that's **󱥦󱤼 suwi mute**!  
If you like maths, you can think of it like opening a bracket, and changing the order of operations: *'cat sweet many'* vs *'cat (sweet many)'*.

Let's look at another example:

<List>
  {/*<Word sl="pi" m="" />*/}
  <Word sl="sitelen tomo" m="a photo of a house" />
  <Word sl="sitelen mute" m="photos" />
  <Word sl="tomo mute" m="houses" />
  <Word sl="sitelen tomo mute" m="photos of a house" />
  <Word sl="sitelen pi tomo mute" m="a photo of houses" />
</List>

Again, you can think of it as *'photo house many'* vs *'photo (house many)'*.  
Of course, **󱤼 mute** isn't the only word **󱥍 pi** helps out with! Let's take a look at some other words:

<List>
  {/*<Word sl="pi" m="" />*/}
  <Word sl="jan pona" m="a nice person" />
  <Word sl="jan lili" m="a small person" />
  <Word sl="pona lili" m="somewhat nice" />
  <Word sl="jan pona lili" m="a small nice person" />
  <Word sl="jan pi pona lili" m="a somewhat nice person" />
</List>

*'person nice small'* vs *'person (nice small)'*.

<List>
  <Word sl="sona utala" m="war knowledge" />
  <Word sl="sona sin" m="new knowledge" />
  <Word sl="utala sin" m="new war" />
  <Word sl="sona utala sin" m="new war-knowledge. the knowledge is recent." />
  <Word sl="sona pi utala sin" m="new-war knowledge. the war is recent." />
</List>

*'knowledge war new'* vs *'knowledge (war new)'*.

*Why are all the translations to English so different?!*, you might ask! English mainly uses *parts of speech* to tell which word belongs to which other word. *Many* is an adjective, but *very* is an adverb. When parts of speech are all the same, hyphens comes to the rescue.

But in Toki Pona, nouns, verbs, and adjectives can all become one another. So they can't help! Instead, Toki Pona uses just one particle to rebracket.
