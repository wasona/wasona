## Cardinal numbers

Let's talk numbers!

<List>
  <Word sl="wan" m="one; united" />
  <Word sl="tu" m="two; divided" />
  <Word sl="luka" m="five, hand" />
  <Word sl="mute" m="many" />
  <Word sl="ale" m="all, every" />
  <Word sl="kipisi" m="piece, part; to split" />
</List>

Toki Pona has words for 1, 2, 5, but not 3 or 4! But this is not so strange. You can imagine **󱥳 wan**, **󱥮 tu**, **󱤭 luka** like coins worth 1, 2, and 5. Let's try counting from 1 to 10:

<List>
    <Word sl="wan" m="one" />
    <Word sl="tu" m="two" />
    <Word sl="tu wan" m="three" />
    <Word sl="tu tu" m="four" />
    <Word sl="luka" m="five" />
    <Word sl="luka wan" m="six" />
    <Word sl="luka tu" m="seven" />
    <Word sl="luka tu wan" m="eight" />
    <Word sl="luka tu tu" m="nine" />
    <Word sl="luka luka" m="ten" />
</List>

In many situations, just knowing small numbers will be enough. But if you want to talk about purchases or the Gregorian calendar, there's an extra page about large numbers below.

## Ordinal numbers

Usually, numbers are just adjectives:

<List>
    <Word sl="kala wan" m="one fish" />
    <Word sl="soko tu tu" m="four mushrooms" />
    <Word sl="mun luka" m="five months" />
</List>

But these are *cardinal* numbers: numbers that talk about quantity. There are also *ordinal* numbers: those that talk about order. To make ordinal numbers, just use **󱤽 nanpa** + a number:

<List>
    <Word sl="nanpa" m="number; the ...-th" />
    <Word sl="kala nanpa wan" m="the first fish" />
    <Word sl="soko nanpa tu tu" m="the fourth mushroom" />
    <Word sl="mun nanpa luka" m="the fifth month" />
</List>

(By the way, **󱤽 nanpa** is special! It doesn't need **󱥍 pi**.)
