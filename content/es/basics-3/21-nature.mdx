We already know most of the words for animal and plant stuff -- let's learn the remaining ones!

<List>
  <Word sl="akesi" m="reptile or amphibian, like a frog, lizard, snake" />
  <Word
    sl="kala"
    m="fish or sea creature, like a salmon, whale, shark, octopus"
  />
  <Word sl="pan" m="starchy food, like wheat, rice, bread, pasta" />
  <Word sl="kili" m="fruit, vegetable" />
  <Word sl="soko" m="mushroom" />
  <Word sl="misikeke" m="medicine" />
  <Word sl="namako" m="spice, garnish, adornment" />
  <Sentence sl="soko li kili nasa." m="Mushrooms are strange fruit." />
  <Sentence
    sl="kala suli li alasa e kala lili."
    m="A large fish hunts smaller fish."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="mi o moku e misikeke lon tenpo mute."
    m="I have to frequently take medication."
  />
</List>

## Ingredients

Bread products are often used to hold together several different ingredients:

<List>
  <Sentence sp="󱥋󱤧󱤓󱤉󱥢" sl="pan li jo <u>e soweli</u>." m="The pizza contains meat." />
  <Sentence sp="󱥋󱤧󱤓󱤉󱤚" sl="pan li jo <u>e kili</u>." m="The pizza contains vegetables." />
  <Sentence sp="󱥋󱤧󱤓󱤉󱥸" sl="pan li jo <u>e namako</u>." m="The pizza contains condiments." />
</List>

But how do we put them together into a single sentence? Well, each of them is the *object* of a sentence. A sentence can have *several objects*: several **󱤉 e**-phrases, which simply go one after the other:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sl="pan li jo e soweli e kili e namako."
    m="The pizza contains meat, vegetables, (and) condiments."
  />
</List>

This is not special to just **󱤉 e**! You can combine several related ideas into one sentence with **󱤧 li**, **󱤡 la**, and prepositions too. For now let's just look at **󱤧 li**:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan li alasa e kala." m="The person hunts fish. (= the person fishes)." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li seli e ona." m="The person cooks them." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li moku e ona." m="The person eats them." />
  <Sentence sl="jan li alasa e kala, li seli e ona, li moku e ona." m="The person hunts fish, cooks them, eats them." />
</List>
