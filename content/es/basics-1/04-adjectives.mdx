## Describe!

Now you know some nouns (things) and verbs (actions). Time to add adjectives (descriptions)!  
Let's memorise a few of them:

<List>
  <Word sl="suli" m="large, important" />
  <Word sl="lili" m="small, young" />
  <Word sl="pona" m="good, pleasant" />
  <Word sl="ike" m="bad, unpleasant" />
  <Word sl="wawa" m="powerful, amazing" />
  <Word sl="sona" m="knowledgeable, wise" />
  <Word sl="suwi" m="cute, sweet" />
</List>

In English, adjectives go before the noun. But in Toki Pona, they always go after:

<List>
  <Word sl="soweli suli" m="a large animal" />
  <Word sl="pipi lili" m="a small bug" />
  <Word sl="waso suwi" m="an adorable bird" />
</List>

English speakers sometimes find this order confusing, but this is how it works in French, Irish, Arabic, Malay, and many other languages. Think of it this way: the first word is always the most important!

Let's make some sentences with descriptions:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sl="waso li lukin e soweli suwi."
    m="The bird sees a cute animal."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli wawa li moku e kasi suli."
    m="The strong animal eats large plants."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="pipi ike li moku lili e soweli."
    m="Mean bugs bite the animal a little."
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="waso sona li sona pona e pipi."
    m="The wise bird knows bugs well."
  />
</List>

If these sentences feel long and tiresome, don't worry! We will look at some shorter sentences soon. Remember: the sentence structure is actually quite simple! You can always tell which part is the subject, the verb, and the object, by looking at **󱤧 li** and **󱤉 e**.

Here's something interesting: in English, adjectives only go on nouns. But in Toki Pona, they can go on verbs too: _to bite a little_ ~ _moku lili_, _to know well_ ~ _sona pona_. There is no difference between adjectives and adverbs in Toki Pona.
