Nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, preverbs -- you have learned a lot by now! Let's slow down. As you know, language learning often focuses on drilling sentence after sentence. But getting good isn't just about repetitive bits of practice. It's also about listening, and reading, and talking to people.

For this lesson, let's read a short story in Toki Pona! It only uses the words and grammar we've learned so far.

## part 1: kalama li lon ma

Listen to an audio recording, and follow along in the text. 

<audio controls preload src={`${KALAMA}/kala-asi/story/1.mp3`} />

After you're done listening, try to read the text aloud. See if you can follow the meaning of the text! Once you're done practicing reading and listening, you can check the translation!

You may notice the translation isn't quite as literal as the example sentences! This is common. Once you have a story that spans several sentences, they start to help each other along.

Did any Toki Pona sentences or translations give you pause? Perhaps you still don't fully understand them? Good! That, too, is part of learning. This is where the community comes along. Join an active Toki Pona group, show them the sentences, and ask for advice. There are always people who will gladly help!
