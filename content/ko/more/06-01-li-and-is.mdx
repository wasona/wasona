When learning a second language, it's natural to try to find analogues between the words you already know and the words you learn. English learners often look at Toki Pona and think '󱤧 li' and 'is' are the same:

<List>
  <Sentence sp="󱥴<b>󱤧</b>󱥔" sl="waso <b>li</b> pona." m="The bird <b>is</b> good." />
</List>

Unfortunately, this is incorrect! They are different words, and they exist for different purposes. Let's talk about why 'is' and 'li' exist.

## Why does 'is' exist?

In English, all meaningful words are divided into nouns (like '*person*'), adjectives (like '*good*'), and verbs (like '*eat*'). There are other parts of speech too, but we can ignore them now.

In English, a sentence must have a verb.
* *The person eats.* (✅ there is a verb!)
* *The person good.* (❌ no verb! not allowed!)
* *The person an animal.* (❌ no verb! not allowed!)

So what happens if we want to state a noun or an adjective? Those statements get a linking verb 'is':

* *The person eats.* (✅ there is already a verb! no 'is' necessary!)
* *The person **is** good.* (✅ there is a verb!)
* *The person **is** an animal.* (✅ there is a verb!)

Also, 'is' is only one of many forms of the verb 'to be': *be, am, is, are, was, were, been, being*. Other forms fulfil the same purpose, but they also carry other information, for example past tense.

## Why does '󱤧 li' exist?

**󱤧 li** tells us something is *a statement*:

<List>
  <Word sl="jan li moku." m="The person eats." />
  <Word sl="jan li pona." m="The person is good." />
  <Word sl="jan li soweli." m="The person is an animal." />
</List>

The opposite of **󱤧 li** is **󱥄 o** -- instead of a *statement*, it's a *command*:

<List>
  <Word sl="jan o moku!" m="Person, eat!" />
  <Word sl="jan o pona!" m="Person, be good!" />
  <Word sl="jan o soweli!" m="Person, be an animal!" />
</List>

## Aren't these questions the same thing?

Nope! "*Is this a verb or a noun/adjective?*" and "*Is this a statement or a command?*" are two questions that exist *independent* of one another! Let's take a closer look at these four sentences:

<List>
  <Word sl="jan li moku." m="The person eats.<br />Statement → 󱤧 li. Verb → no 'to be'." />
  <Word sl="jan li pona." m="The person is good.<br />Statement → 󱤧 li. Adjective → needs 'to be'." />
  <Word sl="jan o moku!" m="Person, eat!<br />Command → 󱥄 o. Verb → no 'to be'." />
  <Word sl="jan o pona!" m="Person, be good!<br />Command → 󱥄 o. Adjective → needs 'to be'." />
</List>

Now you know that a sentence can have 'li' and no 'to be', and it can have 'to be' and no 'li'. So, there is no relation between the two!
