As you know by now, these five preverbs are widely used:

<List>
  <Word sl="wile" m="to want to ..." />
  <Word sl="ken" m="to be able to ..." />
  <Word sl="kama" m="to begin to ..., to become ..." />
  <Word sl="awen" m="to continue to ..., to still ..." />
  <Word sl="alasa" m="to try to ..." />
</List>

There are four other preverbs that are worth knowing, but not everyone uses them:

<List>
  <Word sl="sona" m="to know how to ..." />
  <Word sl="open" m="to begin to ..." />
  <Word sl="pini" m="to finish ...ing" />
  <Word sl="lukin" m="to try to ..." />
</List>

You'll see other people use them, but they're not super necessary. Let's go over what they mean, and how you can speak without them.

## sona-preverb

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi sona toki pona." m="I know how to speak well." />
  <Sentence sl="mi sona sitelen e waso." m="I know how to draw a bird." />
</List>

These ideas can be expressed quite easily with ken-preverb or sona-verb:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi sona e toki pona." m="I know good speech." />
  <Sentence sl="mi ken sitelen e waso." m="I can draw a bird." />
</List>

This might lose a little bit of nuance, but most of the time this nuance is not super necessary.

## open and pini-preverbs

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi open pali." m="I begin to work." />
  <Sentence sl="mi pini pali." m="I finish working." />
</List>

You might notice we already have a preverb that means *'to begin to ...'*: **󱤖 kama**. But when teaching the language, many teachers didn't give that translation for **󱤖 kama**, instead talking more about the meaning *'to become'*. As a result, many Toki Pona speakers adopted **󱥇 open** for this.

In reality, *'to become'* and *'to begin to ...'* are two sides of the same coin! English uses one with adjectives, and the other with verbs:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi kama sona." m="I begin to know." />
  <Sentence sl="mi kama sona." m="I become knowledgeable." />
</List>

Since in Toki Pona, verbs and adjectives can be used interchangeably, there's no need for this distinction.

**󱥐 pini** can be useful on its own, but it can be easily rephrased as *'to begin to not ...'*

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi kama pali ala." m="I begin to not work. = I finish working." />
</List>

Or simply a **󱥐 pini**-verb:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi pini e pali mi." m="I finish my work." />
</List>

## lukin-preverb

As a preverb, **󱤮 lukin** means the same exact thing as **󱤃 alasa**:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi alasa sona e nimi." m="I try to learn the words." />
  <Sentence sl="mi lukin sona e nimi." m="I try to learn the words." />
</List>

So, what's the difference? **󱤮 lukin**-preverb comes from jan Sonja before she added the word **󱤃 alasa** to Toki Pona, while **󱤃 alasa**-preverb comes from community usage. Nowadays, around 15% of people use **󱤮 lukin**, and 15% use both interchangeably, and the majority, 70%, only use **󱤃 alasa**.[^1]

Why did **󱤃 alasa** win out? I think it's for two reasons:
* **󱤃 alasa** has a more obvious link to "trying" than **󱤮 lukin** does.
* **󱤮 lukin** is already used a lot, for eyes and seeing, while **󱤃 alasa** is comparatively less used -- so it's nice to give it a bigger purpose.
