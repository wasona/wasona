(For convenience, let's only use the Latin alphabet here. The [lesson on names](en/07) shows everything you need for *sitelen pona*!)

Do you need to memorise language and country names? Well... yes and no.

Names for languages and countries in Toki Pona are only [approximations](en/make-a-name#3-how-do-we-make-the-name-work-in-toki-pona) of their name in the relevant language. For example, *ma tomo Towano* is an approximation of how someone living in Toronto pronounces *Toronto*. But a British person visiting Toronto might call it *ma tomo Tolonto*, and that's fine. The name isn't set in stone.

But keep in mind that we want to use *endonyms* (local names) for things, because it's the nice thing to do. But for many languages and countries, you might not always know the self-name. Here are a few examples:

* ma Sonko -- zhōngguó -- China
* ma Palata -- bhārat -- India
* toki Maja -- magyar -- Hungarian
* toki Sumi -- suomi -- Finnish
* toki Kipe -- shqipe -- Albanian

If you didn't know about these endonyms before, it's a good idea to remember them! You don't need to memorise the Toki Pona version -- ideally, you'll be able to come up with it on the spot, just by remembering the endonym.

What if your conversation partner said the name of a language or a place, and you don't know what it is? The easy way is to switch to English and ask for clarification. But this is no fun! It's way more fun to explain a country in Toki Pona:

**jan A:** mi wile tawa ma Lowasi.  
**jan U:** ma Lowasi? ona li seme?  
**jan A:** ona li lon ma Elopa.  
**jan A:** n...  
**jan U:** jan Nikola Tesa li tan ma ni.  
**jan A:** aaa. sona.
