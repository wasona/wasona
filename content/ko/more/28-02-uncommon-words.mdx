This course teaches **131 words**. These words are used by *at least 60%* of Toki Pona speakers. **120** of them were used in **󱤪󱥕 lipu pu** -- *'Toki Pona: The Language of Good'* by jan Sonja, which came out in 2014. A few more words became common in community speech. You can think of these words as *core* or *common* vocabulary, which lets you talk about anything.

Below is a list of words that are *less commonly used*, but still in use by some -- by at least about 10% of Toki Pona speakers. They exist for several reasons:

* Some of them were created early on, for early drafts of Toki Pona. They are redundant in today's speech, but some people are interested in this kind of "digital archaeology"!
* Some of them are attempts to fill seeming 'gaps' in the language, to make it function better. Let's discuss why these attempts didn't sway most proficient speakers!
* Some of them are in-jokes. Let's explain their history!

## lanpan

<List>
  <Word sl="lanpan" m="to steal, to take (59%)" />
</List>

**󱦅 lanpan** was created in 2017. Its use has remained reasonably stable since then, though still a lot of people report not using it. Its appeal probably comes from wanting an opposition between *put* (**󱥌 pana**) and *take*. The more established way to say "take" is **kama jo** or 'to begin to have'.

Over time, it has slowly drifted from meaning 'to take' (its original purpose) to instead mean 'to steal', so you might think of it as a more specific kind of **kama jo**.

**󱦅 lanpan** has enabled the central pun of jan Temili's [lanpan pan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=85QCBpcx0Hs), a translation of Jay Foreman's 'Stealing Food'.

## meso

<List>
  <Word sl="meso" m="middle, neither of the two extremes (52%)" />
</List>

**󱦂 meso** was created by jan Olipija in 2020. jan Olipija wanted to be able to describe being 'hard of hearing' as neither hearing nor deaf, without emotional connotations. **󱤠󱥈 kute pakala** or **󱤠󱤨 kute lili** may be unthoughtful, and **󱤠󱤏 kute insa** may be misunderstood, for example, as talking about the inner ear.

However, most people using **󱦂 meso** today are unaware of its origins, and use it as a generic translation for 'in-between, middle, average'. For that purpose, **󱤏 insa** usually works just fine. **󱤾󱤂 nasa ala** or **󱤨 lili** might also work for you. Sentences such as these are usually more insightful than **󱦂 meso**:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="telo en nena la tomo li lon insa." m="As for the river and the hill, the house is in between them." />
  <Sentence sl="suli sijelo la mi nasa ala." m="As for my height (or weight), I'm fairly average." />
  <Sentence sl="mi pilin pona lili." m="I feel somewhat fine. I feel about average." />
</List>

## oko

<List>
  <Word sl="oko" m="eye (52%)" />
</List>

**󱥺 oko** was one of the early words created for the language, but in her 2014 publication, jan Sonja presented **󱥺 oko** and **󱤮 lukin** as synonyms. Early Toki Pona wasn't quite as creative with nouns converting into verbs and the other way round, so as people got better at the language, it became more obvious that **󱤮 lukin**, when used a noun, can simply replace **󱥺 oko** entirely, so a separate word for 'eye' is no longer needed.

## epiku

<List>
  <Word sl="epiku" m="epic, awesome, amazing (50%)" />

{/*

  <Word sp=" " sl="kulijo" m="coolio" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="oke" m="okay" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="wa" m="wow" />

*/}

</List>

{/*

These words were created in 2017-2020. They're all interjections, although you'll sometimes see one in a full sentence. They all either come straight from English, or share a related interjection in English.

*/}

**󱦃 epiku** was created in 2019, and reached its peak popularity in 2020. It's most frequently used as an interjection. It's technically from French, but everyone understands its popularity is directly related to English.

We saw **󱦃 epiku** and similar English-derived interjections quite a bit in 2020-2022. As more people became proficient, they began to play around more with *common words* in these roles instead. Interjections like **󱥵 wawa!** became [more commonly used](https://ilo.muni.la/?query=wawa+-+wawa_2&minSentLen=1&scale=rel&field=hits&start=1470009600&end=1722470400&smoothing=2&smoother=gauss), and made these uncommon word interjections obsolete. You can see more examples in [lesson 18](https://wasona.com/en/18/#interjections).

{/*

**kulijo** has made an appearance in jan Usawi's [likujo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSvCudF5A0).

*/}

## su

<List>
  <Word sp="&#xF19A6;" sl="su" m="(to interact with) 'The Wonderful Wizard of Oz (Toki Pona edition)' (50%)" />
</List>

**&#xF19A6; su** refers to the [third book](en/jan-sonja/) by jan Sonja after **󱤪󱥕 lipu pu** and **󱤪󱦈 lipu ku**. It was published in 2023. Our polling says fewer people use the word **&#xF19A6; su** than the words **󱥕 pu** and **󱦈 ku**. Why is that? The exact cause-and-effect is hard to trace, but here are some observations:
* Our polling is quite recent (within a year after the release of the book), and more books in the series are coming. **&#xF19A6; su** could move into the 'common' section some time in the future.
* While **󱥕 pu** and **󱦈 ku** are books *about* Toki Pona, **&#xF19A6; su** is a book *in* Toki Pona.
* Some people are eager to talk about words and grammar that is or isn't present in jan Sonja's works. People like to list the **󱥂󱥕 nimi pu** and the **󱥂󱦈 nimi ku**. If **&#xF19A6; su** is primarily a book, **󱥕 pu** and the **󱦈 ku** are also a *style*.

Food for thought: is there a practical difference between thinking of **su** as a regular word, vs thinking of **su** as a proper name?

## majuna

<List>
  <Word sl="majuna" m="old (46%)" />
</List>

**󱦢 majuna** was one of the early words created for the language, but it was not included by jan Sonja in her 2014 publication. It saw a resurgence in 2017, as the early *ma pona* Discord was keen on early rejected words. Since then, you would see it from time to time. In 2024 its self-reported use jumped up -- maybe due to the publication of **󱤪&#xF19A6; lipu su**, where jan Sonja uses **󱦢 majuna**.

We can talk about oldness with common words:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mama mama mi li awen lon tenpo suli." m="My grandparent has lived for a long time." />
  <Sentence sl="len ni li sin ala." m="These clothes are worn out." />
  <Sentence sl="toki Emeki li toki pi tenpo weka." m="Sumerian is an ancient language." />
</List>

## jasima

<List>
  <Word sl="jasima" m="mirror, to mirror (43%)" />
</List>

**jasima** was created in 2018. It was probably created to fill some 'gap' for the meaning of 'opposite'. Toki Pona has a preposition **sama** 'same as', but no dedicated preposition meaning 'opposite to'.

This meaning was very confusing, and so in practice, the word has slowly morphed into something about mirrors. Of course, Toki Pona has many ways to talk about opposition, reflection, and mirrors:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi lukin e mi lon sinpin." m="I look at myself in the mirror." />
  <Sentence sl="ilo lukin li pana e sitelen ante." m="The mirror gives off an inversed image." />
  <Sentence sl="sinpin pi tomo mi li lukin e sinpin pi tomo sina." m="My building faces yours. My building is opposite yours." />
</List>

## linluwi

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="linluwi" m="the Internet, network (38%)" />
</List>

**linluwi** gained popularity in 2020, and has remained relatively stable since then.

The Internet is complicated. It is so important to us, and yet it means something different to everyone. Is it a connection? A collection of devices? A collection of documents? A metaphorical place? The word **linluwi** gives us a way not to think about it. It is a shortcut that avoids what Toki Pona is best at: breaking down complex ideas into the parts that are important to you.

I enjoy this example of jan Sonja talking [about a WiFi network](https://bsky.app/profile/tokipona.org/post/3lhti3v32ok2p). It is baffling that a home appliance can't operate on its own, isolated from *other devices*. **kulupu ilo** is a great way to say exactly as much as the reader needs to hear, and no more.

Of course, your wording is likely going to be different in another situation! Perhaps it's important whether the connection is wired or wireless. Or that youre talking to people you know, or just reading posts from people you don't. Or that you're not seeing people's faces, just their texts. Take the time to think of what 'the Internet' really means to you, and to your situation!

## nimisin

<List>
  <Word sp="󱥂󱥝" sl="nimisin" m="any non-pu word; any new word; any joke word (38%)" />
</List>

The Toki Pona community has a complicated relationship with Toki Pona words.
1. Some words were created by jan Sonja, others by the community.
2. Some words were created in Toki Pona's infancy, others in the late 2010s-early 2020s.
3. Some words appear in jan Sonja's books, others don't.
4. Some words were created to make the language work better, others to be funny.
5. Some words are genuinely widely used, others are only remembered because they are written down.

To many beginners, this is overwhelming. A shortcut arose organically, without anyone trying hard to make one. Many people, especially learners, started to refer to any word as a **nimisin** if it's community-created, or new, or a joke, or unused, or not featured in the books.

It's a tempting, simple model, but I don't think it solves the complexity, it just hides it. **󱥾 tonsi** is widely used, but was created in 2019. **󱦀 kijetesantakalu** was created as a joke, but some people today use it in earnest. **mulapisu** was made by jan Sonja, but as a one-off joke in a Discord conversation almost no one remembers today. Which of them are **nimisin**? None of them? All of them? Nobody knows, because the word isn't meant to be clear.

If you're a learner, "used or unused" is the most important thing! For this purpose, we've created four categories: "core words", "common words", "uncommon words", "obscure words". This course only teaches core and common words, and right now you're reading about uncommon and obscure words.

## ali

<List>
  <Word sp="󱤄" sl="ali" m="all, every, 100 (32%)" />
</List>

**󱤄 ali** is an alternate pronunciation and spelling of **󱤄 ale**. The meaning is the same. It was created early on, because some early Toki Pona speakers were uncomfortable with **󱤄 ale** being so similar to **󱤂 ala**. Since then, **󱤄 ale** has been the default or first entry since 2001, including in all official websites and books.

Between 2001 and 2017, both pronunciations were about equally frequent. Starting around 2017, **󱤄 ale** started [slowly overtaking](https://ilo.muni.la/?query=ale%2C+ali&minSentLen=1&scale=rel&field=hits&start=1470009600&end=1722470400&smoothing=2&smoother=gauss) **󱤄 ali** in use. Nowadays, **󱤄 ale** is used about 10 times as much as **󱤄 ali**.

## kokosila

<List>
  <Word sl="toki pona taso" m="only Toki Pona" />
  <Word sl="kokosila" m="to speak a different language, despite <b>󱥬󱥔󱥨 toki pona taso</b> (26%)" />
  {/*<Word sp=" " sl="penpo" m="related to <b>󱥬󱥔󱥨 toki pona taso</b>" />*/}
</List>

**󱥬󱥔󱥨 toki pona taso** describes a situation where people agree to talk to each other *only in Toki Pona*. This usually happens within a Discord channel or an event. **󱥬󱥔󱥨 toki pona taso** helps people develop their Toki Pona skills by giving them a reason to speak the language instead of falling back on a different common tongue, like English.

**󱦄 kokosila** is a recent joke describing a phenomenon in Esperanto: to *['krokodili'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/krokodili#Esperanto)* is to speak among Esperantists in a language besides Esperanto. The most frequent use of **󱦄 kokosila** is to call other speakers to get back on the same language we're here to learn and speak: **󱥄󱦄󱤂 o kokosila ala!**. Of course, we can easily do that with just core words:

<List>
  <Word sl="o toki pona!" m="Speak Toki Pona! Speak clearly! <i>Ne krokodilu!</i>" />
</List>

{/*

On the [ma pona](https://discord.gg/6zkugJFU4x) Discord server, **󱥬󱥔󱥨 toki pona taso** is also a scheduled event. Every two weeks or so, the entire server tries to speak only in Toki Pona. This **󱥫󱥍󱥬󱥔󱥨 tenpo pi toki pona taso** has been humorously nicknamed **tenpo penpo**.

*/}

## usawi

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="usawi" m="magic (23%)" />
</List>

**usawi** was created in 2019 to refer to magic or technology so complex it's indistinguishable from magic. The technology-related meaning never took off, so today people understand **usawi** as just magic and everything related to it. Toki Pona can talk about magic using words such as **󱥵 wawa**, **󱤾 nasa**, and **󱤘 ken**:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi o suli e ken utala mi." m="I should learn another attack spell." />
  <Sentence sl="o toki ala e wawa pi tenpo weka, jan nasa o. tenpo open ona la mi lon." m="Do not cite the Deep Magic to me, Witch! I was there when it was written." />
</List>

The word **usawi** influenced the name of a prominent Toki Pona musician, [jan Usawi](https://www.youtube.com/@janusawi8794).

Food for thought: in a world where magic definitely exists, is magic seen as strange, or is it just another ability or strength a person may have?

## wuwojiti

**wuwojiti** is a mnemonic -- a memorisation tool to help you remember that the syllables *wu*, *wo*, *ji*, *ti* [do not exist](en/make-a-name#short-guidelines) in Toki Pona. It doesn't really mean anything by itself, other than calling your attention to those syllables.

## texture words

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="kiki" m="pointy, sharp (21%)" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="puwa" m="fluffy, soft (10%)" />
</List>

**kiki** and **puwa** were created in 2020-2021, and refer to how things feel to the touch. They sound much like [bouba and kiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bouba_and_kiki), nonsense words created to test sound symbolism across the world's languages. **kiki** is directly inspired by bouba and kiki, while **puwa** is more of a happy coincidence.

Toki Pona can describe sharpness and fluffiness in full sentences. It helps to describe what your skin or hands feels:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="palisa selo soweli li pakala lili e luka mi." m="The animal is spiky." />
  <Sentence sl="linja soweli li sama ko tawa luka mi." m="The animal's fur is fluffy." />
</List>

## apeja

<List>
  <Word sl="apeja" m="shame, embarrassment, dishonor (18%)" />
</List>

**󱦡 apeja** was made as 'an experimental idea in a forum post' in 2009. In 2016-2020, it was one of the more popular words on this list, and was one of the first words to receive a *sitelen pona* glyph by the community. Since 2021, it slowly faded to obscurity.

It has got a nice sound and an angsty meaning, so it's frequently appeared in songs, like jan Lija's [apeja li mi](https://janusawi.bandcamp.com/track/akesi-apeja-li-mi) (cover by [jan Usawi](https://www.youtube.com/@janusawi8794)) or [o lape](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1_Uys7SNlg) by [kala pona Tonyu](https://www.youtube.com/@kalapona).

In casual conversation, **pilin anpa** adequately describes apeja.

## powe

<List>
  <Word sl="powe" m="fake, false (18%)" />
</List>

**󱦣 powe** was made at some point in the 2000s. It shares a similar story with **󱦡 apeja**: early experiment, received a sitelen pona glyph by the community, declined since 2021. We can express that something is 'false' or 'unreal' using core words:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="ni li lon ala!" m="This is not true!" />
  <Sentence sl="ma ni li lon lawa mi taso." m="This place only exists in my mind." />
</List>

## omekapo

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="omekapo" m="eat a good fish! (15%)" />
</List>

**omekapo** was created in 2020 in reference to a 2019 Toki Pona meetup in Texas, where jan Sonja signed a copy of **lipu pu** belonging to jan Maliku, and wrote: *'o moku e kala pona.'* The event took place at a sushi restaurant, so she was wishing jan Maliku to enjoy their food. The community enjoyed this story, and it became an in-joke way to say 'goodbye'. It was common knowledge in 2020, but quickly went obscure afterwards.

The common ways to say 'goodbye' include:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi tawa." m="I'm going." />
  <Sentence sl="o tawa pona!" m="Go well!" />
</List>

## isipin

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="isipin" m="to think (13%)" />
</List>

**isipin** was created in 2020. Usually people start using it because they don't know how to say 'to think'. Toki Pona has several ways to talk about thoughts. You can use different ones, depending on your intentions:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi toki insa e pilin mi." m="I'm pondering my feelings. (= talking internally)" />
  <Sentence sp="󱤴󱥎󱤉󱥁" sl="mi pilin e ni: ..." m="I think that... (= believe, feel)" />
  <Sentence sl="mi sitelen insa e ma." m="I imagine a landscape. (= draw internally)" />
</List>

**󱥬󱤏 toki insa** is taught in the foreword of the 2014 book.

## quotation words

<List>
  <Word sp="&#xF199E;" sl="te" m="opens a quote (13%)" />
  <Word sp="&#xF199F;" sl="to" m="closes a quote (13%)" />
</List>

**&#xF199E; te** and **&#xF199F; to** were created in 2020. At first, they were created to distinguish talking *about* something and *saying* something. Of course, we can draw this distinction with core words, too:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi toki e ijo pona." m="I speak of matters related to goodness." />
  <Sentence sl="mi toki e nimi Pona." m="I say the word <i>'pona'</i>." />
</List>

Over the years, **&#xF199E; te** and **&#xF199F; to** largely disappeared as *words*, but people continue to use them frequently when typing in sitelen pona. They act as a convenient shortcut to type a CJK-style corner bracket:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sp="󱥞󱥬󱥩󱤴&#xF199E;󱤴󱥷󱤷&#xF199F;"
    sl='sina toki tawa mi: "mi wile moli"'
    m='you tell me: "i want to die"'
  />
</List>

## yupekosi

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="yupekosi" m="to behave like George Lucas and revise your old creative works and actually make them worse (13%)" />
</List>

**yupekosi** is a random keysmash from a conversation in 2019. It is a joke about making new words for Toki Pona, which is similar to taking a well-rounded creative work and extending it in ways that, most of the time, will feel misplaced.

{/*

## noises

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="nja" m="nya, cat noise" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="jonke" m="hjönk, goose noise" />
</List>

These words were created in 2021. Naturally, people bring them up mostly for humour. **jonke** is inspired by Untitled Goose Game. **nja** is not a valid sequence of sounds in Toki Pona, but it pokes fun at **󱦆 n**, which is in a similar predicament. Some people still like **nja**, because we love cats. I've not see a **jonke** in years.

*/}

## number words

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="san" m="three (11%)" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="po" m="four (7%)" />
</List>

Over the years, some people have felt discomfort from the Toki Pona number system(s). Some people would design systems that more closely matched those they're familiar with, particularly Indo-European and Sinitic numerals, which have one root word for each word from 1 to 10.

These experiments left behind two obscure words: **san** 'three' and **po** 'four' -- amusingly, from two different proposals. They have appeared in jan Usawi's [likujo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOSvCudF5A0). The word **san** has influenced the Toki Pona name of [mun Kekan San](https://www.youtube.com/@gregdan3d/), a fellow teacher and prominent Toki Pona speaker.

In the end, none of those systems gained much popularity. We can easily express numbers [from 1 to 10](en/25) with core words, and there are well-established ways to talk about [larger numbers](en/large-numbers).

{/*

## queer words

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="melome" m="gay, achillean" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="mijomi" m="lesbian, sapphic" />
</List>

Toki Pona calques of English 'MLM' and 'WLW'. Can be easily expressed in full sentences, like in [lesson 26](en/26).

*/}

## portmanteaus

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="kamalawala" m="anarchy (9%)" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="wasoweli" m="both-bird-and-mammal-like creature (7%)" />
</List>

These two words are interesting because they share pretty much the same creation story. They are shortenings or portmanteaus of existing Toki Pona words, created within a specific story -- jan Wesu's [jan pi kamalawala](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/340307145373253642/721262364187426836) and akesi kon Nalasuni's [Caves of Qud mod](https://discord.com/channels/301377942062366741/301378960468738050/690041651397132345). Outside these stories, of course, you can just describe them with a sentence or two.

**kamalawala** occasionally crops up in political conversations, because people enjoy discussing anarchism, and [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Rux982I-MA), because it is fun to say.

## colour words

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="kapesi" m="brown, grey (9%)" />
  <Word sp=" " sl="unu" m="purple (8%)" />
</List>

Toki Pona has five colour words: **󱥲 walo**, **󱥏 pimeja**, **󱤫 loje**, **󱤒 jelo**, **󱤣 laso**. Two other ones, **kapesi** and **unu**, gained popularity in 2021, but slowly declined back to obscurity since then.

Using common words, you can achieve specific hues and shades like brown or purple by mixing colour words together (**loje laso**, **jelo pimeja**, or other combinations). Often, you don't even need that level of specificity, and just one colour word will be a sufficient description. You can also talk about the colour associated to a real object, like **kule ma**.

Courses usually teach **󱤫 loje** as 'red, reddish', which includes 'magenta' as a reddish hue. Over time, community acceptance of magenta as a **󱤫 loje** has varied a bit. When asked whether they would call magenta **󱤫 loje**, only a third of respondents answered yes in 2021, but a sizeable majority in [2024](https://antetokipona.infinityfreeapp.com/kule/kule.php?lang=tok&i=1). This likely mirrors a quick adoption and quick decline of **unu**.

**kapesi** has appeared in a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArGaIGXJCZE) by kala pona Tonyu.

{/*

## pake

## jami

<List>
  <Word sp=" " sl="jami" m="yummy" />
</List>

**jami** was created several times in 2017-2020, perhaps to mirror **jaki**. It was mildly popular in 2020, and made a bit of a resurgence in 2024.

It is essentially just **󱥦 suwi**. Both words can refer to food specifically, or to feelings in general.
