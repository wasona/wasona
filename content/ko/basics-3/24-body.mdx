We already know the words for *eyes*, *heart*, *face*, and *back*, so let's learn the remaining parts of the body!

<List>
  <Word sl="lawa" m="head; to lead" />
  <Word sl="kute" m="ear; to hear" />
  <Word sl="nena" m="bump, like a nose, hill, breast" />
  <Word sl="uta" m="mouth, lips; to kiss, to bite" />
  <Word sl="sijelo" m="body" />
  <Word sl="luka" m="hand, arm; to touch" />
  <Word sl="noka" m="foot, leg" />
  <Word sl="palisa" m="long hard thing, like a branch, rod, staff" />
  <Word sl="linja" m="long flexible thing, like a string, rope" />
</List>

Something fun to notice is how many parts of the body have an associated action! The head leads, the eyes see, the ears hear, the mouth kisses, the heart feels, the hands touch.

<List>
    <Sentence sl="mi wile suli e linja lawa mi." m="I want to grow out my hair." />
  <Sentence sl="jan lawa mi li kute e toki ike mi." m="My boss heard me running my mouth." />
  <Sentence sl="ilo lukin li pana e sitelen ante." m="The mirror gives off an inversed image." />
  <Sentence sl="sijelo mi li wile e lape." m="My body requires rest." />
