## Two writing systems

You've already seen how Toki Pona uses the Latin alphabet, which we call _sitelen Lasina_. But many of us also use our own unique script called _sitelen pona_, meaning _good writing_. It is a logography: every word in Toki Pona gets its own little character. It's a lot of fun to use, and also helps you memorise words!

Let's take a look at a short poem and compare _sitelen Lasina_ and _sitelen pona_:

<Tabbed id="1">
  <Row sl="sina olin e utala." m="You love conflict." />
  <Row sl="taso sina sona ala:" m="But you don’t understand" />
  <Row sl="utala li ike e sina." m="that conflict makes you worse." />
</Tabbed>

(from [utala](https://utala.pona.la/toki-musi-lili/#utala) by jan Ateneja, 2020)  

Here are some things to notice here:

- Sentences in _sitelen Lasina_ start with lowercase letters, unlike English!
- _sitelen Lasina_ uses punctuation like English, but _sitelen pona_ doesn't.
- 󱥠󱥔 _sitelen pona_ is very intuitive! The glyph for "love" is hearts. The glyph for "conflict" is swords. The glyph for "make worse" is a frown.

{/* TODO: extra lesson on standard punctuation. As of April 2025, the Association is looking into studying it. I'll wait on that. */}
