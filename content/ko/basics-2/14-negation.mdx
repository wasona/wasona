## Negation

We've just learned how to ask someone to do something. But how do we ask someone *not* to do something? It's time to learn about negation, using **󱤂 ala**:

<List>
  <Word sl="ala" m="not" />
</List>

In English, it's kind of a special word. But in Toki Pona, its a pretty normal adjective! And like any other adjective, it goes after the word. You will often find it on nouns, adjectives, and verbs alike:

<List>
  <Word sl="jan ala" m="no person, not a person" />
  <Sentence sl="jan ala li wile utala." m="No person wants to fight." />
  <Word sl="suli ala" m="not big, not important" />
  <Sentence sl="ni li suli ala tawa mi." m="This is not important to me." />
  <Word sl="moku ala" m="not to eat" />
  <Sentence sl="pipi li moku ala e soweli." m="Bugs do not eat animals." />
</List>

But interestingly, **󱤂 ala** also goes on prepositions and preverbs:

<List>
  <Word sl="wile ala" m="to not want to ..." />
  <Sentence sl="sina wile ala moku e suwi." m="You do not want to eat sweets." />
  <Word sl="tawa ala" m="to not go to ..., not towards ..." />
  <Sentence sl="pipi li tawa ala kasi." m="The bug does not go to the plant." />
</List>

You may notice something interesting. Although **󱤂 ala** can go anywhere that an adjective can, it likes to attach to the first word in the verb:
* **󱤧󱤶󱤂 li moku ala ...**
* **󱤧󱥷󱤂 li wile ala ...**
* **󱤧󱥩󱤂 li tawa ala ...**

This actually makes a lot of sense -- negating the first word in the verb also negates the whole sentence, which we often want!
