Let's learn how to be more expressive in Toki Pona!

<List>
  <Word sl="pilin" m="to feel, to experience; heart" />
  <Word sl="jaki" m="dirty, disgusting, rotten" />
  <Word sl="monsuta" m="scary thing, fear" />
  <Word sl="pakala" m="to break, to harm" />
  {/* <Word sl="taso" m="but, only" />*/}
</List>

## 󱥎 pilin

To talk about how they feel, people often use the verb **󱥎 pilin** with an adjective:

<List>
  <Word sl="pilin pona" m="to feel good" />
  <Word sl="pilin wawa" m="to feel powerful" />
  <Sentence sl="mi pilin nasa." m="I feel strange." />
  <Sentence sl="sina pilin seme?" m="How are you feeling?" />
  <Sentence sl="mi pilin monsuta tan soweli." m="I am scared of animals." />
</List>

You can also talk about something affecting **󱥎 pilin sina**, *your sensations*:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="sina pona e pilin mi." m="You make me feel better." />
  <Sentence sl="kon li jaki tawa pilin." m="The air feels foul to me." />
</List>

## Interjections

*Interjections* are short phrases that can occur on their own, without a full sentence. They can serve as greetings, expressions of emotion, or work as responses in conversation.

Let's look at a few common Toki Pona interjections:

<List>
  <Word sl="toki!" m="Hello! Let's talk!" />
  <Word sl="pona!" m="Good!" />
  <Word sl="sona." m="I see. Understood. Got it." />
  <Word sl="wawa!" m="Incredible! Amazing!" />
  <Word sl="lon." m="That's true." />
  <Word sl="kama pona!" m="Welcome!" />
</List>

But it's not a complete list! In the right context, almost anything could be an interjection:

<List>
  <Word sl="pipi!" m="(Aaah!) A bug!" />
</List>

One special interjection, however, is **󱤀 a**:

<List>
  <Word sl="a" m="ah, huh, oh" />
</List>

It's less of a word, and more of a stand-in for any sorts of sounds of excitement, hesitation, joy we might make. It often goes with other interjections, or in full sentences:

<List>
    <Word sl="suwi a!" m="How sweet!" />
    <Word sl="a, ken." m="Ah, perhaps." />
    <Word sp="󱤀&zwnj;󱤀&zwnj;󱤀" sl="a a a!" m="hahaha!" />
</List>

When used in full sentences, it emphasises whatever it comes after:

<List>
    <Sentence sl="mi sona ala a e ni!" m="I do <strong>not</strong> know that!" />
</List>
