## Prepositions

Now that we know some countries, let's talk about travel! But how do you say "go to" and "come from"? For that, we will need some verbs and prepositions:

<List>
  <Word sl="weka" m="to remove, to go away; absent, away" />
  <Word sl="pana" m="to give, to put" />
  <Word sl="kama" m="to come, to arrive" />
  <Word sl="awen" m="to stay, to remain, to protect" />
  <Word sl="tawa" m="to, towards" />
  <Word sl="lon" m="at, on, in" />
  <Word sl="tan" m="from, because of" />
</List>

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  If your language has noun case, please think about
  how "tawa, lon, tan" compare to your noun cases.
  The terms "dative case" and "locative case" are
  especially important to check.
*/}

A _preposition_ is a word that goes before another word. It tells you how it relates to the sentence. A preposition + the word it attaches is called a _prepositional phrase_:

<List>
  <Word sl="tawa soweli" m="towards the animal" />
  <Word sl="lon ma" m="on land, in the country" />
  <Word sl="tan tomo" m="from the house" />
</List>

In Toki Pona, prepositional phrases can be used one of two ways. Firstly we can attach them at the end of a sentence. We can use this to mention location and direction of an action:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="mi pana e waso tawa kasi." m="I put a bird onto a tree." />
  <Sentence sl="waso li awen lon kasi." m="The bird remains on a tree." />
  <Sentence
    sl="sina weka e waso tan kasi."
    m="You remove the bird from the tree."
  />
</List>

Secondly, what if we want to talk about location or direction...without anything else happening? Fortunately, we can do that too. Prepositional phrases can come directly after **󱤧 li**, and act as the verb all by themselves. When prepositions act as verbs, they mean: **󱥩 tawa** 'to go to', **󱤬 lon** 'to be at', **󱥧 tan** 'to come from':

<List>
  <Sentence sl="jan Ema li tawa ma Nijon." m="Emma goes to Japan." />
  <Sentence sl="jan Nina li lon ma Lusi." m="Nina is in Russia." />
  <Sentence sl="jan Mili li tan ma Kanse." m="Millie is from France." />
</List>

Let's practice with these sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence
    sl="mi tawa ma kasi."
    m="I go to the plant land.<br />(Could be a forest, a grassy field, somewhere lush.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="sona li weka tan mi."
    m="Knowledge went away from me.<br />(I forgot.)"
  />
  <Sentence
    sl="soweli suwi li pona tawa mi."
    m="Cute animals are good to me.<br />(I like cute animals.)"
  />

{/* A note for translators */}
{/*
  Some languages have a verb "I like ...",
  other languages have a verb more like "to me it is nice ...".
  If your language is more like the second group,
  you might not need the text in brackets.
*/}

  <Sentence sl="jan Nowa li toki tawa jan Ema." m="Noah speaks to Emma." />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan li toki Tosi lon ma Tosi."
    m="People speak German in Germany."
  />
</List>
