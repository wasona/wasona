**Wasona needs translators!** Wasona is currently available in [English](/), [German](/de/), [Russian](/ru/), [Polish](/pl/), and [Hebrew](/he/). If you want to add a new translation, tell me on Discord (@kala_asi) or via email (kala.asi.la@gmail.com). I'll help out in any way I can!

**Some notable languages without good Toki Pona courses**: Hindi, Swahili, Thai, Vietnamese, Turkish. If you speak any of them, we would love your help!

**Some notes for translators:**

* You can find course files in English [on Github](https://github.com/wasona/wasona/tree/main/content/en). They can be opened in any simple text editor. To translate the course, download the files, and change the text in each one.
* You can't translate UI just yet. This requires some work on my part. We can talk about it later!
* Your audience is different from the English course audience! From time to time, you will need to change wording to be appropriate for your language and readers.
* If you can, please find another speaker of your language to proofread your translation! I'll proofread as well through machine translation.
* If you are not familiar with Github, send your translation to me (@kala_asi). If you are, you can open a pull request.
* Your translation will be shown on the site once you finish the 29 main course pages. Try to translate the extra pages too, but if you can't, we can leave it for the future!
* By submitting your work to me, you release it under the CC-BY-SA license. This is the same kind of license Wikipedia uses, it keeps this work free and available.
