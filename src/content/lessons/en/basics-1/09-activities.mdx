## Activities

Let's learn some more words for things you can do!

<List>
  <Word sl="utala" m="to fight, to attack" />
  <Word sl="lape" m="to sleep, to rest" />
  <Word sl="kalama" m="to produce a sound; sound" />
  <Word sl="musi" m="to have fun; funny, amusing, interesting" />
  <Word sl="nasa" m="strange, unusual, silly, drunken" />
  {/*<Word sl="lipu" m="paper, card, book, website; a flat thing with 󱥡 info" />*/}
</List>

These words are pretty straightforward! Let's use them in sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="soweli li utala e jan." m="The animal attacked someone." />
  <Sentence sl="sina lape lon tomo." m="You sleep at home." />
  <Sentence sl="nimi ona li nasa tawa mi." m="Her name is strange to me." />
  <Sentence
    sl="jan lili li musi tan kalama."
    m="The child is having fun because of noises."
  />
</List>

## Preverbs

Sometimes we want to talk not only about the activity itself, but about how we relate to it. Maybe we _want to_ do something. Maybe we _can_ do something. Maybe we _start_ or _keep on_ doing something.

In English, these are known as *auxilliary and modal verbs*. Toki Pona has a similar system, we like to call them _preverbs_! A preverb is an added verb that goes before the main verb. You already know some of them! Let's learn what they mean when they act as preverbs:

<List>
  <Word sl="kama" m="to begin to ..., to become ..." />
  <Word sl="awen" m="to continue to ..., to still ..." />
  {/* <Word sl="sona" m="to know how to ..." /> */}
</List>

Only a few verbs in Toki Pona are allowed to be preverbs. So let's also learn the remaining ones:

<List>
  <Word sl="wile" m="to want to ..." />
  <Word sl="ken" m="to be able to ..." />
  <Word sl="alasa" m="to try to ..." />
</List>

Preverbs are very versatile! Let's look at some phrases with preverbs:

<List>
  <Word sl="wile lape" m="to want to sleep" />
  <Word sl="awen pona" m="to continue to be good" />
  <Word sl="kama sona" m="to become knowledgeable, to learn" />
  {/* <Word sl="sona sitelen" m="to know how to draw" /> */}
  <Word sl="alasa kama wawa" m="to try to become strong" />
</List>

Let's try to use preverbs in sentences:

<List>
  <Sentence sl="waso lili li wile lape." m="The small bird wants to sleep." />
  {/* <Sentence sl="jan li sona moku e kasi." m="People know how to eat plants." /> */}
  <Sentence sl="mi kama sona e toki pona." m="I learn Toki Pona." />
  <Sentence sl="sina alasa tawa ma Tosi." m="You try to go to Germany." />
  <Sentence
    sl="toki ona li awen nasa tawa mi."
    m="His speech is still strange to me."
  />
</List>
